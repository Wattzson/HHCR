# What is this?
###### This is a custom layout I created using bootstrap for a local non-profit, Halfway Home Christian Residence.


* The home page for the layout I created can be viewed at https://wattzson.github.io/HHCR/ 
* All links direct to the current website for HHCR, http://www.halfwayhomeinc.org/home.html  
* Although they loved the layout, HHCR decided they preferred having a website on a CMS so they can manage it themselves.
